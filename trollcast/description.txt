=============================
 Trollcasting at its best :)
=============================

Server serve it's file(s) all the time. As soon at new scanlines come in,
publish 'have' messages.

Client listens to new have messages, and get all scanlines upon connection.

The sattorrent.cfg holds info on the local host and the remote hosts. The local
host should also be configured as a remote host in order to receive one's own
data.


Status
======

server.py is functional. However, it lacks support for multiple files and
choking.
On file moving out, wipe out old stuff.


client.py is functional. Future features:
 - automatic lag/timeout computation based on previous data exchange
 - automatic computation of satellite reception time based on an observer point or an area of interest.

Protocol
========

requests:
scanline : get the data of a specific scanline
scanlines : get the times of the available scanlines for a given satellite::

  scanlines NOAA18
  scanline NOAA18 time_start time_end

How does it work?
